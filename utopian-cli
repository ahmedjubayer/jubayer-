Parents are always worried about their children's education, there is no time to test them. If you put extra pressure on this a lot of time, there will be no additional results, there may be other side effects. The children should be encouraged rather than at the time they know they can write well.
1.**Came the test season**
Keep an eye on them that they are healthy at this time. During the test, children do not want to eat and drink. The brain's fuel or energy comes from glucose. And glucose is in the sugar. On the morning of the test, the sugar can be given to the national food such as vegetables, soft khichuri, bread, cereals and fruit juice. From the normal diet, the child gets glucose easily. Do not let the child go without eating. Milk is not bad either. Many do not feed eggs during testing, for superstition. Eggs are an endogenous source of proteins, cholesterol and vitamins. Do not nurture the superstitious child.
2.**How to keep healthy**
Do not give ice cream or freezers cold water at this time. Many people are awake at night during the examination. Awakening the night, but do not remember reading, it is necessary to have a steady period of time to be stored on the level of the brain that is read all day. So if the brain does not give more time to rest, then you will not miss any reading.
3.**The imposition of unrest at the time of testing**
An unstable brain is released from the brain, causing the sympathetic system to become active. Chest rash, dry mouth, thirst, excessive sweating, closing urine - signs of these. Studies have gone wrong, the answer is wrong. So stay as stable as possible. Parents must be healthy.
